### Architecture

Hindsight consists of three types of plugins: Input, Analysis, and Output. All plugins are written in Lua and based on
the [Lua Sandbox] (https://github.com/mozilla-services/lua_sandbox) project.

#### Input Plugins

Input plugins are used to transform external data formats into a Heka messages for processing.  Each input plugin runs
on a dedicated thread and all messages generated by the plugins are multiplexed to a single output stream.

#### Analysis Plugins

Analysis plugins are used for simple or complex event processing such as: aggregation, sessionization, anomaly
detection etc.  Analysis plugins can share a thread of execution; the work distribution across threads is user
configurable and can be tailored to specific use cases and needs e.g., by performance characteristics, work load
distribution or type. Every analysis thread uses a dedicated reader to process the data stream produced by the input
plugins. The messages generated by all analysis plugins are multiplexed to a single output stream.

#### Output Plugins

Output plugins are used transform the internal Heka messages into whatever format is needed e.g., txt, html, tsv, alternate
binary encoding. The message/transformation can then be feed to other systems such as data warehouses, information retrieval
indexes, dashboards, notifiers etc. Each output plugin runs on a dedicated thread and has its own readers to process the data
stream produced by the input and analysis plugins. The input and analysis streams are multiplexed with the oldest message
being delivered first.

#### Sample High Level Data Flow

#### Reliability

##### Durability

The durability of the data is equal to durability of storage where the `output_path` (data stream files) and
`sandbox_run_path` (sandbox state preservation files) are configured.

##### Delivery Guarantee

The at least once delivery guarantee only applies to software failures. There are no guarantees if the underlying
storage system fails. Crashing or killing the Hindsight process should not cause any messages to be lost or skipped
and will, at most, duplicate/re-process one second of data on restart. However, sandbox state is only preserved on
a clean shutdown i.e., if an analysis plugin was counting the number of messages going through the system, and the
system was killed, the count would be reset to last saved state. This behaviour should be taken into account
for any plugins performing and preserving stateful analysis.

#### Dynamic Plugin Loading

The Hindsight infrastructure can be run as a service with no initial business logic loaded since all plugin types can
be dynamically loaded and unloaded as necessary.

```lua
sandbox_load_path     = "hs_load"
sandbox_load_interval = 60
sandbox_run_path      = "hs_run"
```

##### Starting a New Plugin

1. `cp test.lua hs_load/analysis/test.lua`
1. `cp my_test.cfg hs_load/analysis/my_test.cfg`
1. `cp your_test.cfg hs_load/analysis/your_test.cfg`
1. *Hindsight scans the directory*
1. test.lua is moved to hs_run/analysis/test.lua
1. my_test.cfg is moved to hs_run/analysis/my_test.cfg
1. Hindsight attempts to run my_test.cfg
1. your_test.cfg is moved to hs_run/analysis/your_test.cfg
1. Hindsight attempts to run your_test.cfg

##### Restarting a Plugin

1. `cp my_test.cfg hs_load/analysis/my_test.cfg`
1. *Hindsight scans the directory*
1. my_test.cfg is moved to hs_run/analysis/my_test.cfg
1. Hindsight attempts to restart my_test.cfg (no data gaps/loss)

##### Updating the Business Logic

1. `cp test.lua hs_load/analysis/test.lua`
1. *Hindsight scans the directory*
1. test.lua is moved to hs_run/analysis/test.lua
1. Hindsight attempts to restart my_test.cfg and your_test.cfg since they use the same underlying business logic (no
data gaps/loss)

##### Stopping a Plugin

1. `touch hs_load/analysis/my_test.off`
1. *Hindsight scans the directory*
1. hs_load/analysis/my_test.off is deleted
1. hs_run/analysis/my_test.cfg is renamed to hs_run/analysis/my_test.off
1. Hindsight stops my_test.cfg
